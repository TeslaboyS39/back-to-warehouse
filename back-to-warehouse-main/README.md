# Back to Warehouse

**Back to Warehouse** is a 2D survival horror action game where you must fend off waves of zombies to reach the safety of your old workplace—a warehouse now transformed into a safe zone and stronghold amidst a ravaged city. Built with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript, this game delivers an intense yet accessible experience with simple yet challenging mechanics.

## Description
In a post-apocalyptic world drowned in chaos, you sprint through hordes of zombies—regular grunts, hulking tanks, swift runners, and colossal bosses that emerge every 700 points. Arm yourself with a pistol, minigun, or RPG, and strategize to survive against a relentless onslaught of the undead!
